INTRODUCTION
------------

Use the guide with ATADRVR version 13 and with any of Hale's
programs that use ATADRVR version 13:  ATADEMO and ATACT.


WHAT IS PIO?
------------

PIO (Programmed I/O) is a term used by Intel in the x86
architechure to describe a way to access I/O devices and perform
I/O operations.

Big mainframe computers, like the IBM System 390, have "I/O
subsystems" or "I/O channels".  These I/O subsystems and channels
are usually "inteligent" and operate completely independent of
the main processor (or processors) of the system and move huge
amounts of data in and out of the systems main memory without
using the main processor(s) to do any of the. actual data
transfer.

Smaller computers frequently map the I/O device control and
status ports into memory addresses.  This block of memory read or
written by the main processor (or processors) just like any other
locations in main memory.

The Intel x86 uses the (strange?) concept of an I/O address
space.  This address space contains 65536 addresses.  Unlike main
memory addresses which address the location of a single 8-bit
value, each I/O address can be the location of an 8-bit, 16-bit
or 32-bit data item.  These data items are command and control
information for the attached I/O devices.

Just like main memory addresses that start at location zero, I/O
addresses also start at location zero.  But unlike main memory
addresses that are accessed by the normal "load/store" (MOV)
instructions (and other instructions), these I/O addresses can be
read and written only by using some special instructions.  These
are the IN and OUT instructions (and several variations of both).

These IN and OUT instructions are what Intel calls PIO or
Programmed I/O because the main processor must execute a program
containing these instructions in order to perform device I/O
operations including data transfer to/from the device.


THE IN AND OUT INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------

The IN and OUT instructions use the x86 AL and DX registers.  The
I/O address goes into the DX register and the AL register is used
to move the data to or from the device.

To execute an IN instruction, the I/O address is placed into the
DX register and then the IN instruction reads that I/O address
and places the data read into the AL register.

To execute an OUT instruction, the I/O address is placed into the
DX register and the data to be output to the device is placed
into the AL register and then the OUT instruction writes that
data to the I/O address.

Of course, doing all this requires main processor (x86) time and
takes time away from doing other computations.

There are 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the IN and OUT
instructions.  The 8-bit IN or OUT instruction (also known as INB
or OUTB) transfer data using only the AL register.  The 16-bit
versions, known as INW and OUTW, transfer data using the AX
register.  And the 32-bit versions, known as IND and OUTD, use
the EAX register.


THE STRING VERSIONS OF IN AND OUT
---------------------------------

There are also some special versions of the x86 IN and OUT
instructions to handle the transfer of large blocks of data.
These are known as the "string" versions of IN and OUT, and are
called INSB, OUTSB, INSW, OUTSW, INSD and OUTSD.  These
instructions combine reading (or writing) of an I/O port and
storing (or fetching) of data in main memory plus updating the
memory address.

The IN and INS instructions uses the ES:DI registers for the
memory address.  The OUT and OUTS instructions uses the DS:SI
registers for the memory address.

When combined with another (very strange!) x86 instruction prefix
known as REP (repeat) the INS or OUTS instructions can be used to
move large blocks of data to or from an I/O device.  The REP
instruction prefix uses the CX register.  REP decrements the CX
register each time the INS or OUTS is executed.  REP causes the
INS or OUTS instruction to be repeated until the CX register is
zero.

For example, the result of each REP INSW is:  1) a word is read
from an I/O address and placed into the AX register, 2) the data
in AX is stored in memory at the address ES:DI, 3) DI is
incrmented (or decremented), 4) CX is decremented and 5) all this
is repeated if CX is not zero.

See the ATADRVR file ATAIOPIO.C for some examples of how these
instructions are used.

Of course transfering a large amount of data can take up lots of
x86 CPU time and can impact the overall performance of a system.
To solve this problem on ATA and ATAPI devices, something called
DMA (Direct Memory Access) is starting to be used.  See the
documenation file DMA.UG.


PIO AND ATA/ATAPI DEVICES
-------------------------

ATA and ATAPI devices are based on an old 286 based disk
controller designed for IBM by Western Digital.  This ISA bus
controller used a very simple set of I/O addresses for the
command and status information.  Today these I/O addresses, also
known as ports or registers, are known as the Command Block and
the Control Block registers.  There are eight Command Block
registers and only one Control Block register (in ATA-3 and
ATA/ATAPI-4).

For ATA host adapters, these address (register blocks) are
generally at well known I/O addresses.  For the primary ATA host
adapter the Command Block is at I/O addresses 01F0H to 1F7H and
the Control Block is at I/O address 03F6H.  For the secondary ATA
host adapter the Command Block is at I/O addresses 0170H to 177H
and the Control Block is at I/O address 0376H.  Other I/O
addresses are possible.

All of the ATA registers are 8-bits wide except the ATA Data
register which is 16-bits wide.  Normally the IN and OUT
instructions are used to access all of the ATA registers except
the Data register.  In PIO data transfer mode, large amounts of
data are transferred 16-bits at a time through the ATA Data
register by using the REP INSW or REP OUTSW.


WHAT IS A PIO MODE?
-------------------

A PIO read or write bus cycle is started by the x86 processor
when it executes an IN, INS, OUT or OUTS instruction.  Such a
cycle involves the use of several ISA bus signals.  The timing
requirements for these ISA bus signals when used with an ATA or
ATAPI device must fall into an set of "modes", known as the ATA
PIO Modes.

The oldest and slowest mode are Modes 0, 1 and 2. The newest and
fastest modes are Modes 3 and 4.

PIO Mode 0 is the speed of the 8-bit "ISA" bus in the original
IBM PC and PC/XT.  PIO Mode 1 is the speed of the 16-bit ISA bus
in the original 6MHz IBM PC/AT.  PIO Mode 2 is the speed of the
16-bit ISA bus in the 8MHz IBM PC/AT.  Today, the ISA bus found
in most all computers still runs at 8MHz (as defined by the now
obsolete EISA bus standard).

For ATA/ATAPI devices the following rules should be followed for
all I/O bus cycles that access the ATA/ATAPI Command Block
Control Block and Data registers.

All accesses to the 8-bit Command and Control Block registers
should be performed at PIO Mode 0, 1 or 2 speeds.  The reads and
writes of the Command and Control Block registers are normally
done using the IN (INB) and OUT (OUTB) instructions (so these are
8-bit reads and writes).

All accesses to the 16-bit Data register can be done at PIO modes
0 to 4 depending on what the device supports.  The reads and
writes of the Data register are done using the REP INSW and REP
OUTSW instructions (so these are 16-bit reads and writes).

The ATA/ATAPI Data register is only 16-bits wide so the REP INSD
and REP OUTSD instructions can not be used to transfer data.


WHEN CAN REP INSD/OUTSD BE USED?
--------------------------------

The ATA/ATAPI PIO data transfer path via the ATA/ATAPI Data
register is only 16-bits wide.  The x86 REP INSD and REP OUTSD
can not be use directly with an ATA or ATAPI device.  However,
ATA host adapters are becomming more complex and many of the ATA
host adapters that are attached to a 32-bit bus, such as a PCI
bus, now support transfering data in 32-bit chunks.  This
requires that the ATA host adapter have extra hardware to
assemble two 16-bit words into a single 32-bit double word and to
disassemble a 32-bit double word into two 16-bit words.

This hardware is most likely not enabled in the host adapter at
power up.  The system's BIOS or an OS device driver is normally
required to enable this hardware.  However, once this hardware is
enabled, then it should be possible to use the REP INSD and REP
OUTSD instructions to transfer data.  In this case the ATA host
adapter must generate two 16-bit INSW or OUTSW I/O cycles to the
ATA Data register for each 32-bit INSD or OUTSD I/O cycle that
the x86 executes.

In most systems, the ATA PIO Mode 3 and 4 data transfer rates can
not be achieved unless the x86 uses the REP INSD or REP OUTSD
instructions.  If the x86 uses the REP INSW or REP OUTSW
instructions then only PIO Mode 2 (or slower) is achieved.


USING THE PIO=BYTE COMMAND LINE OPTION
--------------------------------------

This ATACT or ATADEMO command line option causes these programs
to set the ATADRVR PIO transfer width (pio_xfer_width variable)
to 8-bit mode.  This means that ATADRVR will use the REP INSB or
REP OUTSB instructions, or in PCMCIA Memory mode, 8-bit memory
access instructions are used.

In PC Card ATA mode the SET FEATURES FR=01H command must be used
to place the device into 8-bit data transfer mode.

In this mode only lower 8-bits of the ATA data bus are used to
transfer data.

WARNING:  Be careful using PIO=BYTE as some ATA host adapters are
not properly designed and will corrupt data or hang the system
when REP INSB or REP OUTSB are used.


USING THE PIO=DWORD COMMAND LINE OPTION
---------------------------------------

This ATACT or ATADEMO command line option causes these programs
to set the ATADRVR PIO transfer width (pio_xfer_width variable)
to 32-bit mode.  This means that ATADRVR will use the REP INSD or
REP OUTSD instructions when the number of bytes to be transferred
is a mulitple of 4.

In this mode the I/O cycles on the ATA interface use all 16-bits
of the ATA data bus but two ATA bus cycles are generated by the
host adapter for each INSD or OUTSD instruction executed by the
x86.

WARNING:  Be careful using PIO=DWORD as some ATA host adapters
are not properly designed and will corrupt data or hang the
system when REP INSD or REP OUTSD are used.
