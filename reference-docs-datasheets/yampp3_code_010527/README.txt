		yampp-3 source code 2001-05-27



This is the current state of the yampp-3 source code, 2001-05-27.
This code is intended to run on Rev. B of the yampp-3 PCB, but can 
ofcourse be used on compatible systems as well.

It still uses the "old" song selection system as the yampp-2.
However, the disk handling routines has improved a lot and the
obviosly, the new VS1001 handling has been put in.

The codesize is almost at it's maximum at 1F40 bytes.

A .ROM file is included if you don't have the compiler set up.

For now, the documentation is in the code ;-)


Have fun.
